# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libgcrypt: LibGcrypt
libgcrypt: 
libgcrypt: Libgcrypt is a general purpose crypto library based on the code
libgcrypt: used in GnuPG.  We can't start with a new version number because
libgcrypt: libgcrypt was part of gnupg 1.1 and some applications already used
libgcrypt: it and tested for the version number. We believe that the API can
libgcrypt: stay as it is, except that new functions may be added in the
libgcrypt: future.
