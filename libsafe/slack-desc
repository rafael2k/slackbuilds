# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libsafe: The libsafe library protects a process against the exploitation of
libsafe: buffer overflow vulnerabilities in process stacks and against format
libsafe: string exploits.  Libsafe works with any existing pre-compiled
libsafe: executable and can be used transparently, even on a system-wide basis.
libsafe: The method intercepts all calls to library functions that are known to
libsafe: be vulnerable.  Libsafe has been shown to detect several known attacks
libsafe: and can potentially prevent yet unknown attacks.  Experiments indicate
libsafe: that the performance overhead of libsafe is negligible.
